                My name is Meero and I like programming and making music. I know C#, Ruby, and a little bit of Java and
                Elixir. I had always avoided front-end work as CSS intimidated me but learning it has been quite fun and
                challenging!
                I cannot wait until we get into the JavaScript portion of the bootcamp, nor can I wait until we touch on
                the backend stuff.

                I have been learning to drum with a recently purchased electronic drum kit and hope to be able to add that to my
                music. Currently I program my drums in with a drum machine or using my MPD sample pads. I like make hip hop and trap beats the most but also
                hope to begin making some metal as well. My favorite musical acts include Run the Jewels, Kendrick Lamar, Metallica, and Trivium.
